# Challenge2

# For this assignment I started with a basic boilerplate. Next, I started on the header of the page adding the basic elements needed. Then I created a style sheet to start to addthe look of the website. 

# After the header I started to work on the contact me section adding the necessary html elements. Then I added the corresponding css to the style.css page to add the desired look to the website.

# Next I went to the about me section and started working on that adding the necessary html elements. Then I added the corresponding css to the style.css page to add the desired look to the website.

# Finally, I started working on the work section of the page. This section was probably the most challending section. With it needing some complex elements. The hardest part was probably getting the text to overlap the iamges in the section. 

# Once, the page was fully done with all the required elements added. It was time to work on the media features and make sure that when using the website on other media platforms the website is functional.
